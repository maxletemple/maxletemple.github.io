About Me
===

![me](profile.png#end#no-hover)
I am an engineering student at ENSEIRB-MATMECA, located in Bordeaux. My studies focus on analog and digital electronics, signal processing, and automation. My favorite subjects include embedded systems, reprogrammable circuits (FPGAs), and microelectronics. I will be graduating in the coming weeks and am currently seeking my first job opportunity.

This website serves as both my portfolio and blog. I publish articles here about the projects I've worked on, whether related to my school or not. Writing helps me understand complex topics and solidifies my skills.
Professional Experience

### February 2024 - August 2024:

**Final-year internship at CNRS in Lille**. My work involved modifying a multicore RISC-V processor to add an instruction set for analyzing multithreaded programs, then studying its impact on an operating system. More information can be found in the blog post.

### June 2023 - August 2023:

**Second-year internship at the University of Liège**. I ported a set of network measurement tools (Scamper) to a unikernel (Unikraft). The memory usage was reduced by a factor of 1000, and this internship led to a scientific paper. More information can be found in the blog post.
