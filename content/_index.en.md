About Me
===

![me](profile.png#end#no-hover)
I am a graduate engineer from [ENSEIRB-MATMECA](https://www.bordeaux-inp.fr) in Bordeaux. I studied analog and digital electronics, signal processing, and automation. My favorite subjects are embedded systems, reprogrammable circuits (FPGA), and microelectronics. I am currently an FPGA engineer at Trinnov Audio.

This website serves as both my [portfolio](@/blog/_index.md) and [blog](@/blog/_index.md). I publish articles here about the projects I've worked on, whether related to my school or not. Writing helps me understand complex topics and solidifies my skills.

Professional Experience
==

### January 2024 - Present
**FPGA Engineer at Trinnov Audio**. Trinnov Audio is a company that manufactures audio processors. I am part of the team working on their boards.

### February 2024 - August 2024:
**Final-year internship at CNRS in Lille**. My work involved modifying a multicore RISC-V processor to add an instruction set for analyzing multithreaded programs, then studying its impact on an operating system. More information can be found in the blog post.

### June 2023 - August 2023:
**Second-year internship at the University of Liège**. I ported a set of network measurement tools (Scamper) to a unikernel (Unikraft). The memory usage was reduced by a factor of 1000, and this internship led to a scientific paper. More information can be found in the blog post.
